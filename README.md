❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js that demonstrates core frontend concepts such as React Hooks, state management, and Virtual DOM rendering. The game provides an interactive and responsive user experience with real-time updates.

🚀 Project Overview

The Tic Tac Toe Game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid using X and O. The application automatically checks for winning conditions and displays the game result. This project focuses on understanding React fundamentals, efficient UI updates using the Virtual DOM, and clean component-based architecture.

4.🔁 Game reset functionality

5.📱 Responsive and clean UI design

⚙️ React Concepts Used
useState

Manages the game state (current player, board values, game status)

useRef

References DOM elements without causing re-renders

Used for direct manipulation like highlighting winning cells or disabling the board

Virtual DOM
